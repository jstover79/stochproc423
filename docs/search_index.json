A random variable \\(X\\) takes on real number values, but we cannot predict what precise value it will take perfectly… it is random. One can think of performing a random experiment such as rolling a die and letting \\(X\\) be the number of dots on the upper face or observing some physical process like drilling an oil well with \\(X\\) being the amount of oil produced on the first day or growing a plant and letting \\(X\\) be the height of the plant after one month of growth. In all of the examples \\(X\\) just takes on a single numerical value. A stochastic process is like a generalization of a random variable, but it doesn’t have to be a single numerical value and instead can be vector-valued or function-valued. Generally, a stochastic process consists of an index set \\(T\\) which can usually be thought of as time. For each point in the index set \\(t\\in T\\) we have a random variable \\(X_t\\). We write this as \\((X_t)_{t\\in T}\\) or \\(\\{X_t\\}_{t\\in T}\\). We can think of \\(X_t\\) as a random function of time. You have seen functions of time like \\(x(t)\\) where you plug in a \\(t\\)-value and it outputs an exact \\(x(t)\\)-value according to some formula, but for a stochastic process \\(X_t\\), even when the \\(t\\)-value is specified, we cannot know the precise value for \\(X_t\\) since it is still random. The index set is usually a subset of the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb N=\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) or those including zero \\(\\mathbb N_0=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) or a subset of the real numbers \\(\\mathbb R\\). For example, we can have \\(T=\\{1,2\\}\\), \\(T=\\mathbb N_0\\), \\(T=[0,\\infty)\\subset\\mathbb R\\), or \\(T=[0,1]\\). If the index set is discrete, we call it a discrete-time stochastic process and if the index set is continuous (a subset of \\(\\mathbb R\\)), we call it a continuous-time stochastic process. If \\(T=\\{1,2\\}\\), then our stochastic process is \\((X_1,X_2)\\) and is a random point in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\). If \\(T=\\mathbb N_0\\), then our stochastic process is \\((X_0, X_1,X_2,\\ldots)\\) and is a random point in \\(\\mathbb R^\\infty\\) (in other words, a infinite sequence of random numbers). If the index set is a continuous interval such as \\(T=[0,1]\\) or \\(T=[0,\\infty)\\), then we can think of \\(X_t\\) as a random function of \\(t\\). There are two intuitive ways to think about a stochastic process. We can think of it as \\(X_t\\) where it is implied that we have several random variables, one variable for each value of \\(t\\). Alternatively, we can think of the entire random sequence or function as a single object and write \\(X=(X_t)_{t\\in T}\\). This \\(X\\) is not a random variable, it is a stochastic process. Each \\(X_t\\) is a real-valued random variable, but \\(X\\) is vector-valued, sequence-valued, or function-valued. In order to know the ``value’’ of \\(X\\), we have to know the value of each \\(X_t\\) for every possible \\(t\\)-value. We can think of \\(X\\) as a random sequence of numbers, \\(X=(X_0,X_1,X_2,\\ldots)\\) where each \\(X_n\\) is a real-valued random variable.
