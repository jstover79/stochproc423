A random variable \\(X\\) takes on real number values, but we cannot predict what precise value it will take perfectly… it is random. One can think of performing a random experiment such as rolling a die and letting \\(X\\) be the number of dots on the upper face or observing some physical process like drilling an oil well with \\(X\\) being the amount of oil produced on the first day or growing a plant and letting \\(X\\) be the height of the plant after one month of growth. In all of the examples \\(X\\) just takes on a single numerical value. A stochastic process is like a generalization of a random variable, but it doesn’t have to be a single numerical value and instead can be vector-valued or function-valued. Generally, a stochastic process consists of an index set \\(T\\) which can usually be thought of as time. For each point in the index set \\(t\\in T\\) we have a random variable \\(X_t\\). We write this as \\((X_t)_{t\\in T}\\) or \\(\\{X_t\\}_{t\\in T}\\). We can think of \\(X_t\\) as a random function of time. You have seen functions of time like \\(x(t)\\) where you plug in a \\(t\\)-value and it outputs an exact \\(x(t)\\)-value according to some formula, but for a stochastic process \\(X_t\\), even when the \\(t\\)-value is specified, we cannot know the precise value for \\(X_t\\) since it is still random. The index set is usually a subset of the set of natural numbers \\(\\mathbb N=\\{1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) or those including zero \\(\\mathbb N_0=\\{0,1,2,\\ldots\\}\\) or a subset of the real numbers \\(\\mathbb R\\). For example, we can have \\(T=\\{1,2\\}\\), \\(T=\\mathbb N_0\\), \\(T=[0,\\infty)\\subset\\mathbb R\\), or \\(T=[0,1]\\). If the index set is discrete, we call it a discrete-time stochastic process and if the index set is continuous (a subset of \\(\\mathbb R\\)), we call it a continuous-time stochastic process. If \\(T=\\{1,2\\}\\), then our stochastic process is \\((X_1,X_2)\\) and is a random point in \\(\\mathbb R^2\\). If \\(T=\\mathbb N_0\\), then our stochastic process is \\((X_0, X_1,X_2,\\ldots)\\) and is a random point in \\(\\mathbb R^\\infty\\) (in other words, a infinite sequence of random numbers). If the index set is a continuous interval such as \\(T=[0,1]\\) or \\(T=[0,\\infty)\\), then we can think of \\(X_t\\) as a random function of \\(t\\). There are two intuitive ways to think about a stochastic process. We can think of it as \\(X_t\\) where it is implied that we have several random variables, one variable for each value of \\(t\\). Alternatively, we can think of the entire random sequence or function as a single object and write \\(X=(X_t)_{t\\in T}\\). This \\(X\\) is not a random variable, it is a stochastic process. Each \\(X_t\\) is a real-valued random variable, but \\(X\\) is vector-valued, sequence-valued, or function-valued. In order to know the ``value’’ of \\(X\\), we have to know the value of each \\(X_t\\) for every possible \\(t\\)-value. We can think of \\(X\\) as a random sequence of numbers, \\(X=(X_0,X_1,X_2,\\ldots)\\) where each \\(X_n\\) is a real-valued random variable. Definition. A stochastic process \\(X\\) is a collection of random variables indexed by a set \\(X=(X_t)_{t\\in T}\\). For each \\(t\\in T\\), \\(X_t\\) is a \\(S\\)-valued random variable, that is each \\(X_t\\) takes values in \\(S\\). The set \\(S\\) is called the state space. Definition. For stochastic process \\(X=(X_t)_{t\\in T}\\) with state space \\(S\\) and index set \\(T\\), the sample path space is \\(\\Omega=S^T\\), that is, if we know the precise value of \\(X_t\\) for all \\(t\\in T\\), then \\(X\\) is a function from \\(T\\) to \\(S\\). Here are some examples of how a stochastic process might model a physical process. Example. Consider the following examples. A plant is growing in a pot and we want to model its total biomass over time for 1 year. Let \\(X_t\\) be the total biomass at time \\(t\\). We consider \\(X_t\\) for each \\(t\\) to be \\([0,\\infty)\\)-valued since biomass is nonnegative and we won’t impose any particular upper limit on biomass. We let \\([0,365]\\) be the (time) index and will measure time in days. The state space is thus \\([0,\\infty)\\) and the sample path space is \\(\\Omega=[0,\\infty)^{[0,365]}\\). Each physical realization of a plant growing from germination to death will give us a particular smaple path realization which will be a function from \\([0,365]\\) to \\([0,\\infty)\\). This is a continuous-time stochastic process. The number of insurance claims per month for a twelve month year. We let \\(X_n\\) be teh number of insurance claims in month \\(n\\) with index set \\(\\{1,2,\\ldots,12\\}\\). The state space is \\(\\mathbb N_0\\) as we could have zero claims in a month or potentially any positive number of claims without any specific upper limit. The sample path space is \\(\\Omega=\\mathbb N_0^{12}\\). A particular sample path realization will be a twelve-tuple (duodecuple) of nonnegative integers, e.g. \\(x=(10,4,0,1,0,8,12,25,37,22,13,9)\\in\\Omega\\). Note that it is important that we consider the ordering of the index set, i.e. that \\(X_1=10, X_2=4\\), etc. Try to construct the following example using the technical stochastic process notation. Practice. Write stochastic process notation for the closing price of a stock each day for one week of five trading days. What is the index set? What is the sample path space? Give a possible sample path realization. Show/hide solution. Solution. Let the index set \\(T=\\{1,2,\\ldots,5\\}\\) represent days one to two hundred. For each day \\(t\\), the random variable \\(X_t\\) is the closing price of the stock on that day. We can write \\(X=(X_t)_{t=1,2,\\ldots,5}\\) or \\(X=(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4,X_{5})\\). The sample path space is \\([0,\\infty)^{5}\\) since each full realization of the stochastic process is a sequence of five dollar amounts. Each dollar amount should be nonnegative since a stock doesn’t ever have a negative price. An example sample path realization might be \\((105.27,103.52,97.21,95.13,96.83)\\).
