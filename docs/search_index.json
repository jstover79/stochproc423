A random variable \\(X\\) is a variable where you must perform a random experiment to determine its value. The sample space \\(S\\) is the set of numerical values that the random variable can take. An event is a subset of the sample space. A random variable can be either discrete (if it takes values in a discrete set such as \\(\\mathbb N\\)) or continuous (if it can take on any value in some intveral). Examples. Let \\(X\\) be the number of dots on the upper face of a dice roll. Let \\(X\\) be the mass of a randomly selected person form a specific population. Let \\(X\\) be the number of cars that pass by a given intersection druing a particular day. Let \\(X\\) be the number of radioactive decays in one hour of some particular material. Definition. A probability function allows us to calculate the probabilities of observing specific numerical values or ranges of values for random variable \\(X\\). A discrete random variable has a probability mass function (pmf) \\(f_X(x)=P(X=x)\\), and a continuous random variable has a probability density function (pdf) \\(f_X(x)\\) which we must integrate to get probabilities \\(P(a&lt;X&lt;b)=\\int_a^b f_X(x)dx\\). The cumulative distribution function (cdf) gives cumulative probabilities \\(F_X(x)=P(X\\leq x)\\). 3.2.1 Bernoulli, binomial, geometric 3.2.2 Uniform, exponential, normal "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
