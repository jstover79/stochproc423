# Introduction {-}

Stochastic processes is the mathematical theory of random phenomena. Our working definition of a random phenomenon or process, is one that we cannot predict accurately. Physical processes are often not predictable for a variety of reasons. Typically, we quantify a physical process somehow, e.g. by taking measurement at specific times. If each measurement is unpredicatable (random), then our sequence of measurements is a stochastic process!

You have seen **random variables** in previous probability or statistics courses. A random variable $X$ takes on real number values, but we cannot predict what precise value it will take perfectly... it is *random*. One can think of performing a random experiment such as rolling a die and letting $X$ be the number of dots on the upper face or observing some physical process like drilling an oil well with $X$ being the amount of oil produced on the first day or growing a plant and letting $X$ be the height of the plant after one month of growth. In all of the examples $X$ just takes on a single numerical value. A **stochastic process** tracks these processes over time. Let $X_n$ be the outcome of the $n^{th}$ die roll, the height of the plant after month $n$, or the amount of oil produced during day $n$. In this way a stochastic process can initially be thought of as a sequence of random variables.

Here are some examples of how a stochastic process might model a physical process.

(1) Modeling the daily closing price of a stock for one year.

(2) Modeling the number of insurance claims in each month over a year.

(3) The number of new infections each day for a particular disease.

(4) Tracking radioactive decays over time.

(5) The location of an animal as it moves through its habitat, e.g. the distance from a bird to its nest as a funciton of time.

Each of these physical phenomena are highly unpredictable, and so we generally treat them as "random."
