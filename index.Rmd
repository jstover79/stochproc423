# Stochastic Processes 

You have seen **random variables** in previous probability or statistics courses. A random variable $X$ takes on real number values, but we cannot predict what precise value it will take perfectly... it is *random*. One can think of performing a random experiment such as rolling a die and letting $X$ be the number of dots on the upper face or observing some physical process like drilling an oil well with $X$ being the amount of oil produced on the first day or growing a plant and letting $X$ be the height of the plant after one month of growth. In all of the examples $X$ just takes on a single numerical value. 

A **stochastic process** is like a generalization of a random variable, but it doesn't have to be a single numerical value and instead can be vector-valued or function-valued. 

Generally, a stochastic process consists of an index set $T$ which can usually be thought of as *time*. For each point in the index set $t\in T$ we have a random variable $X_t$. We write this as $(X_t)_{t\in T}$ or $\{X_t\}_{t\in T}$. We can think of $X_t$ as a random function of time. You have seen functions of time like $x(t)$ where you plug in a $t$-value and it outputs an exact $x(t)$-value according to some formula, but for a stochastic process $X_t$, even when the $t$-value is specified, we cannot know the precise value for $X_t$ since it is still random. 

The index set is usually a subset of the set of natural numbers $\mathbb N=\{1,2,\ldots\}$ or those including zero $\mathbb N_0=\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$ or a subset of the real numbers $\mathbb R$. For example, we can have $T=\{1,2\}$, $T=\mathbb N_0$, $T=[0,\infty)\subset\mathbb R$, or $T=[0,1]$. If the index set is discrete, we call it a **discrete-time stochastic process** and if the index set is continuous (a subset of $\mathbb R$), we call it a **continuous-time stochastic process**. 

If $T=\{1,2\}$, then our stochastic process is $(X_1,X_2)$ and is a random point in $\mathbb R^2$. If $T=\mathbb N_0$, then our stochastic process is $(X_0, X_1,X_2,\ldots)$ and is a random point in $\mathbb R^\infty$ (in other words, a infinite sequence of random numbers). 

If the index set is a continuous interval such as $T=[0,1]$ or $T=[0,\infty)$, then we can think of $X_t$ as a random function of $t$. 

There are two intuitive ways to think about a stochastic process. We can think of it as $X_t$ where it is implied that we have several random variables, one variable for each value of $t$. Alternatively, we can think of the entire random sequence or function as a single object and write $X=(X_t)_{t\in T}$. This $X$ is not a random variable, it is a stochastic process. Each $X_t$ is a real-valued random variable, but $X$ is vector-valued, sequence-valued, or function-valued. In order to know the ``value'' of $X$, we have to know the value of each $X_t$ for every possible $t$-value. 

We can think of $X$ as a random sequence of numbers, $X=(X_0,X_1,X_2,\ldots)$ where each $X_n$ is a real-valued random variable.

**Definition** A *stochastic process* $X$ is a collection of random variables indexed by a set $X=(X_t)_{t\in T}$. For each $t\in T$, $X_t$ is a real-valued random variable, that is each $X_t$ takes values in $\mathbb R$. The sample path space for $X$ is $\mathbb R^T$, that is, if we know the precise value of $X_t$ for all $t\in T$, then $X$ is a function from $T$ to $\mathbb R$.

<!-- <div class="proofbox"> -->
*Solution.* 
Let the index set $T=\{1,2,\ldots,5\}$ represent days one to two hundred. For each day $t$, the random variable $X_t$ is the closing price of the stock on that day. We can write $X=(X_t)_{t=1,2,\ldots,5}$ or $X=(X_1,X_2,X_3,X_4,X_{5})$. The sample path space is $[0,\infty)^{5}$ since each full realization of the stochastic process is a sequence of five dollar amounts. Each dollar amount should be nonnegative since a stock doesn't ever have a negative price. An example sample path realization might be $(105.27,103.52,97.21,95.13,96.83)$.
